# Hillary San Fran Hackathon

During a vacation to San Francisco I participated in a 2-day hackathon where the theme was building something to help engage Hillary Clinton supporters and connect them to each other. Our project was a list of nearby Hillary Clinton events with an option to join the event.

This project is an Angular 1 web application. It was scaffolded with the (amazing!) Gulp-Angular generator and uses HTMl5 geolocation api and stores data with Firebase.
